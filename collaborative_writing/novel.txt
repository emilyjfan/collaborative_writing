Hey. What’s wrong? I hear ya. The news cycle has been terrible… just terrible. Plane crashes and terrorism and plunging oil prices but trust me my friend: things could be worse…. a LOT worse. 

I know what would be worse… You could be me! 

I just woke up from a horrible nightmare.  Thankfully things aren’t that bad.

The weather is beautiful! Birds are singing and I am not dreaming any more.
